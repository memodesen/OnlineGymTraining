# Online-Gym-Training-Website

React,JavaScript based Online Gym Training website is a website that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React codes.

 The reason I created this Online Gym Training website was my desire to bring the product we will create in the Software Engineering course to real life. In doing so, I would be involved in my course and at the same time expand my software knowledge.Here, I expanded my JavaScript knowledge a lot more and had a new experience in React, which I just learned.

In this GYM Training Website, I have included pages on the 5 most important features of our assignment, which as you can see are Filling in Forms, Exercising, Getting Information, Payment System and Contacting. First of all, if we explain the Form Filling section, here we have developed a form that informs the teachers according to the height, weight, fat ratio and the workouts that the customers want. As a 2nd feature, in the Exercise section, we have developed a point system according to the workouts in order to create a more competitive atmosphere for the customers. 3. As a 3rd feature, in the Get Info section, we provided important information and videos about workouts and workouts that customers can access. As a 4th feature, we created a page with a payment system. With the last and most important feature, Get in Touch, we offered a feature that facilitates bilateral communication between customers and coaches.
